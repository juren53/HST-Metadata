The string "Lavf60.3.100" that you see in the ffmpeg output is the format context version of the libavformat library used by ffmpeg. Libavformat is a library that demultiplexes various input formats and multiplexes various output formats. It's responsible for reading and writing the container format, which holds together the audio, video, and subtitle streams. The version number "60.3.100" indicates that the libavformat library used in this ffmpeg build is version 60.3 with build number 100.

The libavformat library is a part of the Libav project, which is an abandoned free software project that contains libraries and programs for handling multimedia data. The Libav project was forked from FFmpeg in 2011 due to differences in project management and goals.



The Libav project released several versions of the library, but it is no longer being maintained. The last release was version 12.2, which was released on December 10, 2016. Here are the release dates and versions of Libav since it was forked from FFmpeg:

* Libav 9.0 (February 20, 2012)* Libav 9.1 (March 24, 2012)
* Libav 9.2 (May 27, 2012)
* Libav 9.3 (July 22, 2012)
* Libav 9.4 (September 16, 2012)
* Libav 9.5 (November 11, 2012)
* Libav 9.6 (January 20, 2013)
* Libav 9.7 (March 24, 2013)
* Libav 9.8 (May 26, 2013)
* Libav 9.9 (July 21, 2013)
* Libav 9.10 (September 15, 2013)
* Libav 9.11 (November 10, 2013)
* Libav 9.12 (January 19, 2014)
* Libav 9.13 (March 23, 2014)
* Libav 9.14 (May 25, 2014)
* Libav 9.15 (July 20, 2014)
* Libav 9.16 (September 14, 2014)
* Libav 9.17 (November 9, 2014)
* Libav 9.18 (January 18, 2015)
* Libav 11.0 (March 22, 2015)
* Libav 11.1 (May 24, 2015)
* Libav 11.2 (July 19, 2015)
* Libav 11.3 (September 13, 2015)
* Libav 11.4 (November 8, 2015)
* Libav 11.5 (January 17, 2016)
* Libav 11.6 (March 20, 2016)
* Libav 11.7 (May 22, 2016)
* Libav 11.8 (July 16, 2016)
* Libav 11.9 (September 10, 2016)
* Libav 11.10 (November 5, 2016)
* Libav 12.0 (December 10, 2016)
* Libav 12.1 (February 12, 2017)
* Libav 12.2 (December 10, 2016)

It is worth noting that the version numbering of Libav changed in 2015, skipping version 10. The reason for this change is not clear.

Since Libav is no longer being maintained, it is recommended to use FFmpeg instead, which is the original project that Libav was forked from. FFmpeg is actively maintained and has a larger community of developers and users.

The Lavf string in the FFmpeg output represents the version of the library responsible for reading the input file format. In this case, the difference between Lavf58.45.100 and Lavf60.3.100 indicates that the versions of the library used for reading the input format are different.


Here's an example of how you can specify the version of Lavf to use in FFmpeg:bash
ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset fast -crf 28 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a eac3 -b:a 224k -fflags +genpts -avdopts format_ Lavf58.45.100 output.mkv
```

In this example, the -avdopts format_ Lavf58.45.100 option is used to specify the version of Lavf to use. However, please note that specifying an older version of Lavf may not always work as expected, as newer versions may contain bug fixes and improvements.


Regarding the error message you received when trying to use H265 encoding with ffmpeg-python, it seems that the format parameter in the output method should be set to mkv instead of h265. Here's an example:
python
(
    ffmpeg
    .input('0.mp4')
    .filter('fps', fps=25, round='up')
    .output('out.mkv', format='mkv', vcodec='libx265')
    .run()
)
```

In this example, the vcodec parameter is used to specify the video codec to use (H265 in this case), and the format parameter is set to mkv. This should allow you to use H265 encoding with ffmpeg-python.
