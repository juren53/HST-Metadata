President Truman's Music Reviewed by Patrick Hayes,SR2008-39,23-Jun-50,Undetermined,"President Truman's Music Reviewed by Patrick Hayes of WQQW, the Good Music Station in Washington, June 23, 1950. Radio program includes a review of President Harry S. Truman's musical knowledge and musical preferences by weekly commentator Patrick Hayes of the Hayes Concert Bureau. Hayes also interviews Anthony Leviero of the Washington Bureau of the New York Times, who had interviewed Truman and others and had written an extensive column on this topic published in the Times on June 18, 1950. Leviero had witnessed several musical performances by President Truman, including one in which he did a 4-hand piano piece with his daughter, Margaret. Leviero and Hayes were most complimentary of the President's knowledge and discriminating tastes in music. Their research shows evidence that the President participated in a concert on April 6, 1902 and others as early as 1898. They credit his boyhood religious training and family encouragement of his music. They state that Mozart is the President's favorite composer, but that he liked works by Bach, Beethoven, and Mendelssohn. His favorite current performer was said to be Ignacy Jan Paderewski. They comment that the President played for Churchill and Stalin at Potsdam. The President attended many concerts, usually meeting with the performers backstage before the performance. The President's interest in music is a boost for the arts in the eye of the public. The President is said to have attended operas at the urging of Bess and Margaret, but that he was not a true opera fan, but that he appreciated some of the music in operas.",,"WQQW (Radio station : Bethesda, MD)",https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/2023-02/SR2008-39.mp3,,,,,,,,,

Upon arrival, he found Truman writing a nominating speech for James Byrnes as Vice-President.

"John W. Snyder is Interviewed by Robert Cochran, continued",SR2008-36,6-Jan-78,Unrestricted,"John W. Snyder interviewed by Robert Cochran for a biography of Snyder, continuation of previous recordings. John W. Snyder, former Secretary of the Treasury, discusses the military build-up to World War II and the fact that the U. S. had used World War I era weapons and materials for training until it became obvious that the U.S. would be involved. The first thing the U.S. did was to build factory capacity for a build-up. They first build weapons for the allies to their specifications. He talked of the need for more steel and what the government had to do to get the steel needed. He mentioned that the aircraft factories were on the west coast because that is where the major aircraft companies were located. The government did not pick the locations of factories, the companies with contracts did. He discusses the beginnings of the Truman Committee and Franklin D. Roosevelt's reluctance to have such a committee. He also relates that Harry S. Truman went to General George C. Marshall to try to get back on active duty while he was a Senator. Mr. Snyder went back to St. Louis in 1943 and was to become bank president on July 1, 1945. Truman summoned him to Washington, DC, in April. He became Secretary of the Treasury following the death of a Supreme Court Justice and Vinson's appointment to that post. He briefly touches on the Korean War and the Senate hearings over the firing of General Douglas MacArthur. He explained that the government had hundreds of accounting systems until the GAO instituted the Uniform Accounting System so all agencies used the same methods, speeding up the time it took to examine records and budgets. Snyder discussed his good relationships with both General MacArthur and General George Patton. He said that MacArthur came to him when he had a problem with his personal taxes and after Snyder helped him with that matter, Snyder, with Truman's permission, sent 28 people to set up tax, budget, and education systems for the Philippines. He discussed visiting Patton's grave in Luxembourg.","Snyder, John W.

Good statistics helped to win World War II. The coordination of government and business is a difficult job, as is gathering consistent information from various government agencies. Federal Reports have helped to make the budgeting process more straightforward and effective. Better information means less red tape and more efficiency in the government. This work gets no headlines, but it's important. This government is the greatest and most powerful in the history of the world. Closes by saying he wishes he could stick around, ""but I am married like most of the rest of you, and the Boss made a date for me to go to a show tonight, and I'd like to go down there and meet her or I'll be in trouble sure enough, and the figures won't mean a thing to me.""

President Truman's Address on the Presentation of the Statue of Andrew Jackson to the People of Jackson County,SR62-119,26-Dec-49,Unrestricted,"In this ceremony at the Jackson County Courthouse Square in Independence, Missouri, President Truman presented the equestrian statue of General Andrew Jackson to the county. The sound recording includes: invocation by the Reverend William B. Garnett of the Trinity Episcopal Church, in Independence; introductory remarks by Judge William J. Randall; introduction of the president by Mayor Roger T. Sermon; President Harry S. Truman's presentation remarks; Margaret Truman's unveiling of the statue as the 371st Army Band plays, under the direction of Chief Warrant Office L.J. Croteau out of Fort Leavenworth, KS; acceptance of the statue by Judge Harry M. Gambrel, presiding judge of the Jackson County Court; benediction by Reverend H.M. Hunt of the First Baptist Church of Independence.

Text not found in the Public Papers; this is the text of President Truman's remarks:

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. That's the shortest speech I've ever heard you make in my life. I appreciate that introduction and I know that you mean every word of it.

You know it's a very great pleasure to me to come back here to Jackson County to take a part in the presentation of this Andrew Jackson statue to Jackson County. When the court houses were built, this one was re-built, back in 1934 they were finished, an immense equestrian statue of Jackson was erected in front of the courthouse in Kansas City. That was in 1934. My daughter unveiled that statue on a day just like this in 1934. It was a little colder, if anything, because it happened to be on the North side of the building.

At that time, Mr. Keck told me that he had a life-size statue which was the second casting before the immense statue in Kansas City was cast, and that he would like to give it to me personally, and I wanted to give it to Jackson County. Everybody was under the impression that the statue I wanted to give to Jackson County was a small thing like this, they didn't understand what it was. I offered it to several of the county courts. And finally Mr. Keck was tired of keeping it in his studio and he wrote me a letter and told me he would like for me to take it off his hands. I wrote this county court, I had never put it up to them before, and they accepted the statue for the city of Independence to be erected on the East side of the courthouse, facing East. And I am most happy to have a part in, as I said before, in this unveiling. (bell tolling)

You know, it's interesting when you survey the history of Jackson County. There's an old record book in the courthouse here in Independence. It's record book #1, and it tells about the erection of the first courthouse here in Independence. That courthouse was built of logs and clapboards. And the contract price for the construction of that courthouse was $150. It sits down here back of the City Hall, almost intact as it was when it was first constructed. In connection with the erection of that courthouse, they held an auction of lots in order to raise the money to build the courthouse. And a part of the expense was $7.50 for four gallons of whiskey and tin cups to drink it with. (laughter) It's a most interesting thing to read that record.

Well now, the reconstruction of this courthouse has been made on, I think, three different occasions. And the cost of the reconstruction has increased in each instance. In this present condition, it cost about $350,000 to remodel it. The courthouse in Kansas City cost a little less than $3.5 M to construct. So, there was a little money left over. And I decided that since the county was named for Andrew Jackson that we ought to take notice of that fact. And I suggested to Tom White that he recommend a sculptor for that purpose. He said that Charles Keck was the greatest sculptor in the country and he had the finest equestrian statue in America at Charlottesville, VA. So Tom White and I made the trip to Charlottesville, VA and saw that statue. And we went on to New York, and made a deal with Mr. Keck and he made the statues of Andrew Jackson which will be the property of Jackson County from now on.

He gave me this one, because he thought-- I don't know what he thought what I could do with it because it's not very--it's not small enough to keep in the house and it's too big to put in anybody's front yard, and it occurred to me that it was just the right size to go with this Independence courthouse. I am happy to be able to present it to you. I'm also extremely happy that my daughter can be here and do the same for this one as she did for the one in Kansas City. Margaret will now perform her part of the job. (applause)","Truman, Harry S., 1884-1972",Tom Evans,https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/sound_recordings_files/sr62-119.mp3,,,,,,,,,
