$@$v=v1.20-rv1$@$When you run an FFmpeg command that involves text rendering, such as adding subtitles or text overlays, FFmpeg needs to choose a font to use. If you don't specify a font explicitly, FFmpeg will fall back to a default font.



The default font selection process is not well-documented, but based on the FFmpeg source code and various online resources, here's what happens:


1. **FFmpeg checks the environment variable FONTCONFIG_FILE**: If this variable is set, FFmpeg will use the font configuration file specified in the variable to determine the default font.

2. **FFmpeg checks the system's font configuration**: If FONTCONFIG_FILE is not set, FFmpeg will use the system's font configuration, which is usually managed by the fontconfig library. Fontconfig is a library that provides a common interface for font management on Linux and other Unix-like systems.

3. **Fontconfig searches for a suitable font**: Fontconfig will search for a font that matches the language and script of the text being rendered. In your case, since you didn't specify a language or script, Fontconfig will likely default to a font that supports the Latin script (e.g., English).

4. **Fontconfig returns a default font**: Fontconfig will return a default font that matches the search criteria. In your case, it seems that Fontconfig returned the Vera.ttf font from the /usr/share/fonts/truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/ directory.


The Vera.ttf font is a part of the Bitstream Vera font family, which is a popular open-source font family designed for use on the web. It's commonly included in many Linux distributions, which is why it's available on your system.

So, to summarize, the Vera.ttf font was selected as the default font because:
* You didn't specify a font explicitly in your FFmpeg command.* The FONTCONFIG_FILE environment variable was not set.
* Fontconfig, the system's font management library, searched for a suitable font and returned Vera.ttf as the default font.

If you want to use a different font, you can specify it explicitly in your FFmpeg command using the -font option, like this:bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf drawtext=text='Hello World':fontfile=/path/to/your/font.ttf output.mp4
```
Replace /path/to/your/font.ttf with the path to the font file you want to use.
