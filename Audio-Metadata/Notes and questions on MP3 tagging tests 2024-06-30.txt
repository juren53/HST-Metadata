Notes/questions on MP3 tagging tests 2024-06-30

Six sample MP3s have been generated in this test case:

SR59-108.mp3  SR59-114.mp3  SR59-185.mp3  SR59-201.mp3	SR59-88.mp3  SR60-59.mp3

These MP3s have a 'first cut' a a collection of tags that are aimed a visibility in our seven target apps:

Windows File Info
Windows Media Player
Apple File Info
Apple iTunes
Adobe Audition
Audacity
VLC

They also include a custom thumbnail with the accession number overlayed on the thumbnail.

Questions and comments:

- Addition of a descriptive meta tag label (preface) as part of the tag - - too much?

e.g.
    TPE1            : Artist: Harry S. Truman Library
    TPUB            : Publisher: U.S. Army Signal Corps
    TDAT            : Date DDMM: 2110
    TYER            : Date YYYY: 1952
    TEXT            : Location: Bridgeport, PA
    TOFN            : Original File Name: SR59-201.mp3
    TORY            : Original Release Year: 1952
    TRDA            : Recording Date: 1952-10-21
    ICRD            : Date String: 21-Oct-52

- Overlayed AN labels on HST thumbnails with 32 pt font - - is this the right size? 
  

- Location is already identified in 'most' descriptions in CSV file but not all.
   This test included a Location tag in the examples using the unoccupied TEXT tag.
   TEXT is the BWF author/writer tag.

    TEXT   : Location: Bridgeport, PA

   automtically appending location to the description or title would appear redundant

- Need to develop method for handling the scenario when there are two or more files for one accession number.
   Could rows be added to the CSV file for each file? The code currently processes one file 
   for each line in the CSV file - - assumes unique accession numbers for each line in the CSV file
