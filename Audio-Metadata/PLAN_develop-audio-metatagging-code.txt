PLAN_to develop-audio-metatagging-code
-----------------------------------

1 read audio csv file into Python dataframe - DONE

  remove the URL prefixes on mp3 filenames in dataframe - DONE

2 analyze/compare mp3 files in CSV to mp3 files in the directory

    build list of mp3 files in CSV - DONE
    build list of mp3 files in directory - DONE

    build a test set CSV file and MP3 files in the current working directory (CWD)

    list mataches between files in CSV file and in the CWD
    list files in the CSV file and NOT in the CWD
    list files in the CWD and NOT in the CSV file

3 add metatags to all matching files

    read the CSV file into a Python dataframe with rows and columns matching the CSV file
    loop through the MP3 file list
    for each MP3 file in the list, determine what row in the dataframe the file is found
    then pull the metadata found in that row and embed it in the MP3 file
