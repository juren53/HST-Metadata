'TRDA' Recording dates   an alt date test for handling dates as strings

'TENC' ‘Encoded by’

'TPUB' Publisher

'TOFN' Original filename   alternative HSTL use: Accession Number


 Notes:

TRDA
The ‘Recording dates’ frame is a intended to be used as complement to the “TYER”, “TDAT” and “TIME” frames. 
e.g. “4th-7th June, 12th June” in combination with the “TYER” frame.  
[ alternative HSTL use: DATE as a string - - could still use the YYYY-MM-DD format; it would keep 
the date from possiblily being rigidly evaluated in context by applications and systems of which there is little knowledge ]

TYER
The ‘Year’ frame is a numeric string with a year of the recording. This frames is always four characters long 
(until the year 10000).   [ though some apps treat it as a longer string ]

TDAT
The ‘Date’ frame is a numeric string in the DDMM format containing the date for the recording. 
This field is always four characters long. [ though some apps treat it as a longer string ]

TIT1
The ‘Content group description’ frame is used if the sound belongs to a larger category of sounds/music. 
For example, classical music is often sorted in different musical sections 
(e.g. “Piano Concerto”, “Weather - Hurricane”).
[alternative HSTL use: TITLE ]

TIT2
The ‘Title/Songname/Content description’ frame is the actual name of the piece 
(e.g. “Adagio”, “Hurricane Donna”).
[alternative HSTL use: SUB-TITLE ]

TIT3
The ‘Subtitle/Description refinement’ frame is used for information directly related to the contents title 
(e.g. “Op. 16” or “Performed live at Wembley”).
[alternative HSTL use: DESCRIPTION ]

TENC
The ‘Encoded by’ frame contains the name of the person or organisation that encoded the audio file. 
This field may contain a copyright message, if the audio file also is copyrighted by the encoder.

TOFN
The ‘Original filename’ frame contains the preferred filename for the file, since some media doesn’t allow 
the desired length of the filename. The filename is case sensitive and includes its suffix.  
[alternative HSTL use: ACCESSION NUMBER - - WAV files listed in CSV file use INAM tag label for Accession No ]
