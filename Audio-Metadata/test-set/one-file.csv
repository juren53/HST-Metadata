Harry S. Truman Interview: American History Textbook,SR84-47,"December 8, 1960

Text not found in the Public Papers; this is the text of President Truman's remarks:

Thank you, Mr. Mayor. That's the shortest speech I've ever heard you make in my life. I appreciate that introduction and I know that you mean every word of it.

You know it's a very great pleasure to me to come back here to Jackson County to take a part in the presentation of this Andrew Jackson statue to Jackson County. When the court houses were built, this one was re-built, back in 1934 they were finished, an immense equestrian statue of Jackson was erected in front of the courthouse in Kansas City. That was in 1934. My daughter unveiled that statue on a day just like this in 1934. It was a little colder, if anything, because it happened to be on the North side of the building.


You know, it's interesting when you survey the history of Jackson County. There's an old record book in the courthouse here in Independence. It's record book #1, and it tells about the erection of the first courthouse here in Independence. That courthouse was built of logs and clapboards. And the contract price for the construction of that courthouse was $150. It sits down here back of the City Hall, almost intact as it was when it was first constructed. In connection with the erection of that courthouse, they held an auction of lots in order to raise the money to build the courthouse. And a part of the expense was $7.50 for four gallons of whiskey and tin cups to drink it with. (laughter) It's a most interesting thing to read that record.


He gave me this one, because he thought-- I don't know what he thought what I could do with it because it's not very--it's not small enough to keep in the house and it's too big to put in anybody's front yard, and it occurred to me that it was just the right size to go with this Independence courthouse. I am happy to be able to present it to you. I'm also extremely happy that my daughter can be here and do the same for this one as she did for the one in Kansas City. Margaret will now perform her part of the job. (applause)","Truman, Harry S., 1884-1972",Tom Evans,https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/sites/default/files/sound_recordings_files/sr62-119.mp3
