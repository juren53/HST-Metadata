@web_search IPTC metadata Application Record Version meaning

IPTC metadata "Application Record Version" refers to the version number of the software application used to create or edit the image file. It
 indicates which version of the IPTC standard was implemented in the specific application.

This tag helps identify:

1. The software tool used to create/edit the image
2. The version of IPTC standard supported by that tool
3. Potential compatibility issues between different versions of IPTC standards

For example, if an image has an Application Record Version of 4.5, it means the image was edited using a software application that supports
 IPTC version 4.5.

This information is useful for:

- Tracing the origin and history of an image
- Ensuring compatibility when transferring images between different systems
- Identifying potential issues related to outdated IPTC implementations

It's important to note that this tag is separate from other IPTC metadata fields like captions, keywords, and copyright information.Based on
