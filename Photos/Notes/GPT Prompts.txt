-----------------------------------------

Using the following Python3 code:

Convert a date represented as NONE to 0000-00-00.

Convert a date represented as just a year YYYY e.g. 1939 to 1939-00-00  where the month and day are 00.

Convert a date represented as Month DD, YYYY  e.g. September 18, 1945 to YYYY-MM-DD.

Convert a date represented as 'ca. YYYY'  e.g. ca.1968 to YYYY-00-00 e.g. 1968-00-00.

Convert a date represented as mmmm YYYY  e.g. July 1948 to YYYY-DD-00.

Convert a date represented as mmmm, YYYY  e.g. July, 1948 to YYYY-DD-00.
------------------------------------------

Write some Python 3 code that converts a date represented as a range e.g. 1901-1905 to the latest year followed by 00 for month and 00 for day.  In this example 1901-1905 would be converted to 1905-00-00.

Convert a date represented as just a year YYYY e.g. 1939 to 1939-00-00  where the month and day are 00.


Convert input dates formated as  day_of_week, MM/DD/YYYY  e.g. Monday, 03/23/1964  to YYYY-MM-DD e.g. 1964-03-23


Also, convert input dates formated as  MMM-YY e.g. 'May-62 to 19YY-MM-00 e.g. 1962-05-00


--------------------------------------------------
tgpt '
Using this python code as an example:
```
    elif re.match(r'c\. \d{4}', date_str):            # test for circa date eg. c. 1939
        year = re.findall(r'\d{4}', date_str)[0]
        return f"{year}-00-00"
```
write a similar elif statement that converts the string "ca.1939" to 1939-00-00

is there a way to fix spaces that break regular expression in Python 3

Yes, there are a few ways to handle spaces that may break regular expressions in
 Python 3. Here are some approaches you can consider:

1. Escape the spaces: If you have a regular expression pattern that contains spaces,
 you can escape them by using the backslash (\) character before each space. For
 example, if your pattern is "hello world", you can modify it to "hello\ world" to
 treat the space as a literal character.

   python
   import re

   pattern = r"hello\ world"
   text = "hello world"

   match = re.search(pattern, text)
   ```

2. Use character classes: Instead of explicitly matching spaces, you can use
 character classes to match any whitespace character. The \s shorthand character
 class matches any whitespace character, including space, tab, and newline.

   python
   import re

   pattern = r"hello\sworld"
   text = "hello world"

   match = re.search(pattern, text)
   ```

3. Enable the DOTALL flag: By default, the dot (.) metacharacter in a regular
 expression does not match newline characters. However, you can enable the re.DOT
ALL flag to make it match all characters, including newlines. This can help if your
 pattern spans multiple lines with potential line breaks.

   python
   import re

   pattern = r"hello.*world"
   text = "hello\nworld"

   match = re.search(pattern, text, flags=re.DOTALL)
   ```

Remember to always use raw strings (prefixed with r) when working with regular
 expressions in Python to avoid unintended escape sequence interpretation.
