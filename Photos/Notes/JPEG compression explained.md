#### JPEG compression explained

# and why applicaltions can take the same image and create widely differing file sizes
          
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) compression is a method used to reduce the size of digital images without significantly degrading their quality. It achieves this through  a process called "discrete cosine transform" (DCT), which transforms the image data from spatial domain to frequency domain. This transformation allows the algorithm to identify and remove high-frequency components that contribute less to the visual appearance of the image, thus reducing the amount of data needed to represent it.

### Why Different Applications Produce Differing File Sizes

1. **Compression Settings**: The level of compression applied can vary between applications. Higher levels of compression result in smaller file sizes but may also lead to more
 noticeable loss of image quality. Software developers can choose different default settings based on their target audience or use case.

2. **Optimization Algorithms**: Different software might use different optimization algorithms under the hood. Some might prioritize speed over achieving the smallest possible
 file size, while others might focus on maximizing compression efficiency.

3. **Metadata Handling**: Images often contain metadata such as EXIF data (camera settings, date taken, etc.). Some applications might compress this data differently or even
 strip it out entirely, affecting the final file size.

4. **Color Space and Bit Depth**: The choice of color space (e.g., sRGB, Adobe RGB) and bit depth (number of bits per channel) can influence how much data needs to be stored to
 represent colors accurately. Different applications might make different assumptions about what color spaces and bit depths are appropriate for the images being processed.

5. **Lossless vs. Lossy Compression**: While JPEG uses lossy compression, there are variations in how aggressively the loss occurs. Some applications might use more sophisticated  methods to decide which parts of the image to discard, potentially leading to better quality at lower bit rates.

6. **File Format Extensions**: Beyond just the JPEG standard, there are various extensions and modifications like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and JPEG XT, each offering different levels of compression and quality. An application might choose to use one of these formats instead of the baseline JPEG format to achieve better results.

In summary, the wide variation in file sizes produced by different applications when processing the same image can be attributed to differences in compression settings,
 underlying algorithms, handling of metadata, color space and bit depth choices, and the specific file format extensions used.
