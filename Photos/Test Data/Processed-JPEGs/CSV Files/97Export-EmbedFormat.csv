Conducting Space Flight Simulations Testing,97-727,None,Unrestricted,"Devices like the Rendezvous Docking Simulator in this photo at the NASA Langley Research Center are being developed by NASA scientists to explore, under controlled laboratory conditions, many complex aspects of space flight. The facility will enable scientists to determine man's ability to complete a rendezvous in either Earth of lunar orbit during the final 200 feet of the docking maneuver. Two research pilots ride in a full-scale model of the Gemini spacecraft and, by operating its controls, bring it into gentle, final contact with a target vehicle. The simulator spacecraft and the target hang on cables from an overhead track. The target can move vertically and laterally, but the spacecraft is capable of all six degrees of freedom of mechanical motion. An analogue computer (not shown) forms an integral part of the simulator system. The arrangement seen here simulates Earth orbit rendezvous and docking as proposed in the Gemini program. Langley Research Center has been conducting scientific studies of space rendezvous and docking problems for several years, and while the versatile facility was particularly designed to aid docking research, it can be adapted for use in other projects requiring dynamic control in six degrees of freedom.","Webb, James E.

Scale model of the Saturn I launch vehicle,97-732,None,Unrestricted,"Photograph showing a one-third scaled model of the Saturn I Block II launch vehicle. Ground wind investigations form an indispensible part of the painstaking research program that lies behind successful flights of launch vehicles of all sizes, and the National Aeronautics And Space Administration Langley Research Center has specialized in such wind-tunnel studies for many years. Here, in a cooperative program with the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, is an installation in Langley's Transonic Dynamics Tunnel of an aero-elastically scaled model of the Saturn I Block II launch vehicle with the Apollo spacecraft and its escape system. It is mounted on a turntable with the umbilical tower so that it can be rotated to receive the force of the wind stream from any direction. Before wind tunnel tests begin, the model is shaken mechanically to determine its vibration characteristics. Surface winds cause steady oscillatory deflection of free-standing launch vehicles which must be thoroughly understood to overcome problems in structural strength, guidance alignment, and instrument checkout. Wind-tunnel test results guide the design of launch pedestals to assure ample strength for any surface wind conditions.","Webb, James E.

It was readout to Goldstone, California Deep Space Network station beginning at 12:51 p.m. PDT. North is approximately at the top of the photograph when it is viewed with the wall of the large depression on the left border. The Sun is then on the right at an elevation approximately 23 degrees from horizontal. The photograph covers an area 59 by 92 miles located on the western edge of Mare Smythii. In the lower right center is a crater about 18 miles in diameter with a central peak. Curving down the picture to the left from the upper right hand corner appears to be the boundary of Mare Smythii and the uplands to the west. The mare has an intricate ridge system to the right of the crater and a moderately high density of small craters. The brighter uplands to the west appear generally rougher than the mare and have typical highland structure. On the left border of the picture is the eastern rim of a large depression. On the left edge of the picture are photographic test patterns which will be used to calibrate the photography. Following this preliminary reassembly, the prime Lunar Orbiter data will be automatically reassembled at Eastman Kodak Co., for detailed study at NASA's Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia.","Webb, James E.

Moon surface photo taken with Lunar Orbiter V,97-741,"Thursday, 08/10/1967",Unrestricted,"This wide angle western looking oblique photograph was taken by Lunar Orbiter V on August 10, 1967, when it was 60 miles above the lunar surface. The elongated crater Messier is in the foreground. It is about 8 miles long, six miles wide, and about 4,000 feet deep. In back of it is the crater Messier A which is about 8 miles in diameter. These craters are located at 47 degrees East longitude and 2 degrees South latitude on the floor or Mare Fecunditatis. A doule ray extends west for about 100 miles from the pair of craters. An interpretation for the peculiar shape of Messier and the rays is that they have been produced by a low angle impact of a meteoroid on the lunar surface. Lunar Orbiter V was one of a series of NASA spacecraft managed by the Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. Prime spacecraft contractor is Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington.","Webb, James E.

Moon surface photo taken with Lunar Orbiter V,97-739,"Friday, 08/18/1967",Unrestricted,"On August 18, 1967, Lunar Orbiter V took this vertical wide angle photograph of the Harbinger Mountains, located at 43 degrees West longitude and 27 degrees North latitude, from an altitude of 83 miles.  At the center of the photograph is Rima Prinz I (Prinze Valley I), at the left is Rima Prinze II.  Prinze II starts at a crater about 2 miles in diameter and runs north in a channel 40 miles long.  The valley is 3,000 feet wide near the head and narrows to about 1,500 feet near the end.  Lying inside the broad valley is a smaller crater about one mile in diameter with its accompanying channel less than 1,000 feet wide.  The valley drops about 4,000 feet form the flank of the Crater Prinz to the mare basin floor.  The channel system seems to record an older broad-valley stage and a younger inner valley stage of development.  An interpretation is that these are records of volcanic eruptions and the flow of fluidal materials downstream, is as terrestrial streams in desert environments.  Lunar Orbiter V was one of a series of NASA spacecraft managed by the Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia.  Prime spacecraft contractor is Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington.","Webb, James E.
