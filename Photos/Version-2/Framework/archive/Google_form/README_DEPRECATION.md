# Google Form Integration - DEPRECATED

This directory contains Google Forms integration code that is no longer used
as the HST Photo Framework has migrated from Google Sheets to Excel spreadsheets.

## Migration Status
- Phase 1: ✅ Core Data Access Layer (Google Sheets → Excel)
- Phase 2: ✅ UI Updates (Google Worksheet → Excel Spreadsheet)  
- Phase 3: ✅ Dependencies Cleanup (Google API → Excel processing)

## Recommendation
This directory can be safely removed in a future release, but is preserved
temporarily for reference and rollback purposes.

## Files in this directory
- form_generator.py (Google Forms to Excel conversion)
- requirements.txt (Google Forms dependencies)  
- token_form_generator.pickle (Forms authentication tokens)
