Warp commands:

OK, let's stage, commit and push these updates.

Lets bump the version to [    ] and the date/time stamp to [      ] per the version rules in Warp.ini  and then generate a related git version tag. 

Lets bump the version to v0.1.3 and the date/time stamp to 2025-12-18 16:15 per the version rules in Warp.ini and then generate a related git version tag.

Prompts used to develop HSTL GUI

Let's develop a Step 6 dialogue that converts the processed TIFFs to JPEGs with all the metadata tags transfering to the JPEGs

Let's develop a Step 7 dialogue the resizes the processed JPEGs to fit in a 800x800 box while maintaining the original aspect ratio and carrying over all the metadata tags.

Let's develop a Step 8 dialogue that overlays a copyright watermark layer on 'Restricted' images.  This step will take the resized JPEGs and look for those that contain the word 'Restricted' in the CopyRight field.  The watermark should be layered over only those JPEGs and they should be stored in the output\jpeg_watermarked directory.  An opacity slider adjustment feature should be included in dialogue. The watermark file to use as an overlay is gui\Copyright_Watermark.png.

Let's develop a Step 4 TIFF Bit Depth Test & Conversion.  This step looks for 16 bit TIFF images, converts them to 8 bit TIFFs and over-writes the 16 bit TIFF in the CWD.  The dialogue should run the test of 16 bit TIFFs and let the user determine if they want to proceed wth 16-to-8 bit conversion.  This dialogue is similar to Step 8 Watermark except in this case the original TIFF is over-written.
