## How to detect Google Sheets vs Google Spreadshet

You can detect the type of Google Sheets URL (whether it's a native Google Sheet or an Excel file being viewed in Google Sheets) by leveraging the Google Drive API. The key is to inspect the `mimeType` of the file associated with the URL.

Native Google Sheets have a `mimeType` of `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`. Excel files, even when uploaded to Google Drive and opened with Google Sheets, retain their original `mimeType` (e.g., `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` for `.xlsx` files).

Here's a Python function that uses the Google Drive API to achieve this.

**Prerequisites:**

Before you can run this code, you'll need:

1.  **Google API Client Library for Python:** `pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`
2.  **Google Cloud Project and API Credentials:**
      * Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
      * Create a new project or select an existing one.
      * Enable the **Google Drive API** for your project.
      * Create **OAuth 2.0 Client IDs** credentials (desktop app type is usually easiest for local scripts). Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the same directory as your Python script.

**Python Code:**

```python
import os
import re
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
from googleapiclient.errors import HttpError

# If modifying these scopes, delete the file token.json.
SCOPES = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"]

def authenticate_google_drive():
    """Authenticates with Google Drive API and returns a service object."""
    creds = None
    # The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
    # created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first
    # time.
    if os.path.exists("token.json"):
        creds = Credentials.from_authorized_user_file("token.json", SCOPES)
    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                "credentials.json", SCOPES
            )
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)
        # Save the credentials for the next run
        with open("token.json", "w") as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())
    try:
        service = build("drive", "v3", credentials=creds)
        return service
    except HttpError as error:
        print(f"An error occurred during authentication: {error}")
        return None

    if match:
        return match.group(1)
    return None

### How the Code Works:

1.  **`authenticate_google_drive()`:**

      * This function handles the OAuth2.0 authentication process.
      * It checks for an existing `token.json` file (which stores your credentials after the first successful authentication). If not found or expired, it will open a browser window for you to log in to your Google account and grant permissions.
      * It then builds and returns a `drive` service object, which is used to make API calls.

2.  **`extract_file_id_from_url(url)`:**

      * Google Sheets URLs contain a unique file ID (e.g., `1mgxguKnNThYH8PspEge6xS2xxPwdU2Qv`). This helper function uses a regular expression to extract this ID from the URL.

3.  **`detect_google_sheet_type(sheet_url, drive_service)`:**

      * Takes the `sheet_url` and the authenticated `drive_service` as input.
      * Extracts the `file_id`.
      * Makes a `drive_service.files().get()` API call to retrieve metadata about the file, specifically requesting the `mimeType` field.
      * Compares the retrieved `mimeType` to known Google Sheets and Excel MIME types:
          * `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`: This is the `mimeType` for a true, native Google Sheet.
          * `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`: This is the `mimeType` for an `.xlsx` (Excel) file.
          * `application/vnd.ms-excel`: This is for older `.xls` Excel files.
      * Returns a descriptive string based on the `mimeType`.
      * Includes error handling for cases like invalid URLs, files not found (e.g., due to wrong ID or permission issues), or other API errors.

### To Use It:

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `sheet_detector.py`).
2.  Make sure you have your `credentials.json` file in the same directory.
3.  Run the script: `python sheet_detector.py`
4.  The first time you run it, a browser window will open for you to authorize access. After that, `token.json` will be created, and subsequent runs will be faster.

This function will give you a clear indication of the underlying file format, which directly explains why your Python code behaves differently when processing the two types of URLs.
