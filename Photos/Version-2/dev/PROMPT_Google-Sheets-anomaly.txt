My Python code does not work properly on this Google Spreadsheet:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mgxguKnNThYH8PspEge6xS2xxPwdU2Qv/edit?gid=1418369420#gid=1418369420

It only accesses some of the data I can see in the web page but ignors certain columns.

When I select 'Save as Google Sheets' under the  File menu, the URL changes to 

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14uNYVk68fFuoQM2exIRTsifkL7brn4pTzqt6DC3M9uk/edit?gid=1418369420#gid=1418369420

and my Python code accesses all the data I see in the in the webpage.  

I would like to understand what is going on here.
