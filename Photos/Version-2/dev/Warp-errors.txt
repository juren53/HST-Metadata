ell me what this means:

I'm sorry, I couldn't complete that request.

Request failed with error: Transport(reqwest::Error { kind: Decode, source: hyper::Error(Body, Error { kind: Io(Custom { kind: BrokenPipe, error: "stream closed because of a broken pipe" }) }) })
This error message indicates a network connectivity issue that occurred while trying to execute your previous request. Let me break down what happened:

Error Breakdown:
•  Transport Error: The underlying network transport layer failed
•  Reqwest Error: This is a Rust HTTP client library error
•  Decode Error: The system couldn't properly decode the response
•  Hyper Error: The HTTP implementation encountered a body processing error  
•  Broken Pipe: The network connection was unexpectedly closed

What this means:
The connection between your client and the server was interrupted while data was being transmitted. This is typically caused by:

1. Network connectivity issues - temporary internet connection problems
2. Server-side timeout - the server closed the connection due to inactivity or processing time limits
3. Large response handling - the response was too large and the connection was dropped
4. Firewall/proxy interference - network security tools interrupting the connection

In the context of your previous request:
You asked me to create a Python module for detecting Google Sheets types. The error occurred while I was trying to process that request, likely due to the complexity of generating the complete module code.

Next steps:
Would you like me to try creating the Google Sheets detection module again? I can break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces to avoid potential timeout issues.

I'm sorry, I couldn't complete that request.
