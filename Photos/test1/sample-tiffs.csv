Original caption: Last step to stardom...the screen test is Hollywood's final proving ground, where weeks and months of hard work and careful preparation bring success or failure.  Here pictures tell the story of a big moment in the career of Ilona Massey, beautiful blonde Continental singing star, who came to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer eighteen months ago, knowing two English words, ""hello"" and ""scrambled eggs"".  Given a brief singing role in ""Rosalie"", she displayed talents worthy of training.  First, she was placed on a scientific diet of salads and fruits to bring her weight down from 135 pounds to a steady 123.  For fifteen months her daily schedule started at 7 A.M., with two hours of singing lessons under the direction of Maestro Romani.  The next two hours were devoted to English lessons supervised by Lillian Burns, instructor on the staff of Billy Grady, talent executive.  Then, from eleven to one, more singing lessons.  Next, an hour for lunch and an hour for rest.  At three o'clock, two hours of dramatic instruction with Miss Burns.  At night, Miss Massey viewed two and sometimes three pictures, learning screen technique.  Greta Garbo, her favorite star, was also her model.  Finally, her long period of probation completed, Miss Massey was selected to co-star with Nelson Eddy in ""Balalaika"".  Brought to the screen by Lawrence Weingarten, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Balalaika"", co-starring Nelson Eddy and Ilona Massey, was adapted from Eric Maschwitz' London musical success.  Reinhold Schunzel directs, with a supporting cast featuring Charlie Ruggles, Joyce Compton, Lionel Atwill, Dalies Frantz, Feodor Chaliapin, Jr. and others. Eyelashes and the job is done...Ilona Massey is now ready for the camera.","Dawson, Donald S. Papers",,,Harry S. Truman Library,
