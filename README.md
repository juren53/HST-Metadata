# Truman Library Audio Visual Metadata Project



The purpose of this project is to adapt and develop tools that can embed metadata in media files at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library i.e. photos, audio, and video files.

The project consists of three phases. The initial focus is the photo collection to be followed by audio files and finally video files at the Library.

This work is under the direction of Laurie Austin, Audiovisual Archives, Harry S. Truman Presidential Library.

## Phase 1  -  Photo Metadata

### Overview:

The goal of this project is to find an automated way to use pre-existing metadata from the
Truman Library photo database, embed certain metadata into fields of the high-resolution TIFFs,
downsize the images to 800x800 pixel JPGs (retaining the metadata), and then upload the
JPGs to the NARA catalog for public use.

### Process steps:

1. Export HST PDB metadata to a CSV file.
2. Gather relevant TIFF files and embed them with CSV metadata
3. Convert TIFFs to JPEGs
4. Scale JPEG images to 800 x 800 pixels, retaining the aspect ratio
5. Add copyright watermark to 'restricted' JPEGs
6. Upload JPEGs to NARA Catalog.

## Phase 2  - Audio Metadata and Uploads to the NARA Catalog

This portion of the Project will embed metadata from the Truman Library archives into approximately 2,000 audio files (WAV and MP3).

### Process steps:

1. Export HST Audio DB metadata to a CSV file.
2. Create HST thumbnail with accession number
3. Embed thumbnail and metadata in MP3 file
4. Upload the MP3s to the NARA Catalog

## Phase 3  - Video Metadata and Uploads to the NARA Catalog

This portion of the Project will embed metadata from the Truman Library archives into video files currently in the HSTL archives
