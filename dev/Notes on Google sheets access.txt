Does Google have CLI tools that help with OAuth account configuration instead for using the Web interface


pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

The error message is clear: "Google Docs API has not been used in project 562755451687 before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting 
https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/docs.googleapis.com/overview?project=562755451687 
then retry."

Great! The script now runs successfully with the specified Google Sheet URL. The fixes that were implemented have resolved the column count mismatch issue, and the script is now able to load the data properly.

The output shows that:

1. The script successfully extracted the spreadsheet ID: 1242AoqE7dYerWTzGS7Kiku5fkN8koLcIt0KwVfCCTho
2. It accessed the sheet named "Template-Bulk"
3. It detected and handled duplicate column names
4. It detected and handled the column count mismatch (52 columns in data but only 51 in header), adding a generic "Column_52" column name for the extra column
5. It successfully loaded the data into a DataFrame with 296 rows and 52 columns
6. It printed a summary of the DataFrame and the first 10 rows of data

The script is now working correctly with the specified Google Sheet URL, and all the required features have been implemented:

1. ✅ Added argparse to handle command-line arguments
2. ✅ Implemented a function to extract the spreadsheet ID from a URL
3. ✅ Updated the main function to use argparse
4. ✅ Fixed the column count mismatch issue
5. ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with the default spreadsheet ID
6. ✅ Added appropriate error handling

The user can now specify any Google Sheet URL using the --sheet-url or -u option, and the script will properly handle the extraction of the spreadsheet ID and loading of the data.


The modifications to the x3.py script have been successful! The script now properly handles Google Sheet URLs via command-line arguments and correctly loads the data into a pandas DataFrame.

Key improvements made:

1. Added support for specifying Google Sheet URLs via the command line using argparse
2. Implemented a robust function to extract spreadsheet IDs from URLs with various formats
3. Fixed a critical issue with column count mismatches that was causing errors
4. Added appropriate error handling and informative warning messages
5. Maintained backward compatibility with the default spreadsheet ID

The script successfully:
•  Extracted the spreadsheet ID from the URL provided
•  Accessed the "Template-Bulk" sheet
•  Handled duplicate column names by adding suffixes
•  Added a generic column name for an extra column found in the data
•  Loaded 296 rows and 52 columns into a pandas DataFrame
•  Displayed a summary of the data and the first 10 rows

The script can be used with any Google Sheet by providing its URL with the --sheet-url or -u option, like you did in your command.
